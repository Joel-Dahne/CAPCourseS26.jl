Classical numerical methods are however not suitable for direct use in proofs, since they introduce errors (rounding and discretization errors). These errors hinder their use in proofs, which require fully rigorous arguments. The area of rigorous numerics tackles these issues by introducing methods to control the errors in a fully rigorous way, that allows for the results to be used in proofs.\n\nAn early, and by now classical, example of a computer-assisted proof is the proof of the existence of the Lorenz attractor in 1999 by Tucker. Over the more than two decades since Tucker's proof, there has been an increase in the adoption of computer assisted proofs in analysis. An example of a recent breakthrough result building on computer-assisted proofs is the proof of blowup for the 3D Euler equation. TODO: Expand on this\n\nThe course is split into 3 parts distributed over 15 weeks. The 3 parts are\n\nIntroduction to computer-assisted proofs (≈ Week 1-4)\nIntroduction to rigorous numerics (≈ Week 5-10)\nComputer-assisted proofs in practice (≈ Week 11-15)\n\nA rough schedule for the first two parts is given below, the precise details for the third part are yet to be determined.\n\nWeek Topic\n1 Introduction to computer-assisted proofs\n2 Discrete problems\n3 Continuous problems\n4 Formal proofs\n5 Floating points and interval arithmetic\n6 Floating points and interval arithmetic\n7 Basic rigorous numerics\n8 Automatic differentiation\n9 Improved rigorous numerics\n10 Improved rigorous numerics\n11 TBD\n12 TBD\n13 TBD\n14 TBD\n15 TBD","category":"section"},{"location":"#Part-1:-Introduction-to-computer-assisted-proofs","page":"Overview","title":"Part 1: Introduction to computer-assisted proofs","text":"The first part of the course will be a general introduction to computer-assisted proofs, from the point of view of rigorous numerics. We will consider both discrete problems, such as the proof of the Four color theorem, and continuous problems, such as the proof of existence of the Lorenz attractor.\n\nComputer-assisted proofs are often mixed up with formal proofs, such as those produced by Lean and Rocq (previously known as Coq), indeed some authors use the term computer-assisted proofs to refer to either. We will take a brief look at formal proofs, with a focus on the differences and similarities between formal proofs and computer-assisted proofs.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Part-2:-Introduction-to-rigorous-numerics","page":"Overview","title":"Part 2: Introduction to rigorous numerics","text":"The second part focuses on the machinery required for constructing computer-assisted proofs in analysis, known as rigorous numerics. This introduction will be partially based on the book Validated Numerics by Warwick Tucker. At the heart of rigorous numerics lies interval arithmetic, indeed the field of rigorous numerics is sometimes just referred to as interval arithmetic.\n\nThe practical parts will primarily be done in Julia, using the packages Arblib.jl and IntervalArithmetic.jl as the base for the interval arithmetic.\n\nHere is an example of how interval arithmetic looks like in practice, here using IntervalArithmetic.jl.\n\nusing IntervalArithmetic\na = interval(1, 2) # The interval [1, 2]\na^2 # Interval gotten from squaring all numbers in [1, 2]\nsin(a) # Interval gotten from applying sin to all numbers in [1, 2]\n\nThe content we will cover includes:\n\nMathematical foundations of floating point arithmetic: floating point formats, rounding\nBasics of interval arithmetic: basic arithmetic, elementary functions, special functions\nBasic rigorous numerics: isolating roots, computing integrals, enclosing extrema\nAutomatic differentiation: forward (and backwards) differentiation, Taylor arithmetic\nImproved rigorous numerics: isolating roots, computing integrals, enclosing extrema","category":"section"},{"location":"#Part-3:-Computer-assisted-proofs-in-practice","page":"Overview","title":"Part 3: Computer-assisted proofs in practice","text":"In the third and final part of the course we will look at what it takes to go from what we have learned about interval arithmetic and rigorous numerics to actually creating a computer-assisted proof. The list of topics covered would depend on the interests of the participants in the course. Possible topics would include the use of computer-assisted proofs in:\n\nSpectral geometry\nDynamical systems\nFluid mechanics\nAnalytic combinatorics\n\nOne could also dive deeper into different algorithms for computer-assisted proofs:\n\nRigorous integration of ODEs\nFinite element methods\nSpectral methods\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)\n\nAlternatively, one can study the lower level details of interval arithmetic, more related to the field of computer algebra.","category":"section"},{"location":"week-7/#Week-7-TODO","page":"Week 7 - TODO","title":"Week 7 - TODO","text":"","category":"section"}]
