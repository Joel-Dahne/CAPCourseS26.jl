# Week 5 Lab: Playing with floating points

In this we will experiment a bit with rounding and arithmetic for
floating points. We will look at

- How rounding interacts with basic arithmetic
- Implement a poor mans interval arithmetic version of ``\sin``

For this we will make use of the `lab-5.jl` Pluto notebook that you
can find in the `notebooks` directory. Recall that you can start Pluto
with

``` julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
using Pluto
Pluto.run()
```

See the Lab 1 and Lab 2 instructions for more details on how to start
Pluto and potential issues you can encounter.
